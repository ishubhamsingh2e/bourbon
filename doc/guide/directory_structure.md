# Directory Structure

When you create a new Bourbon project with `bourbon new myblog`, the following structure is generated:

```
myblog/
├── apps/                # Application modules
│   └── myblog/          # Default app
│       ├── controllers.go
│       ├── migrations/
│       ├── models.go
│       └── routes.go
├── static/              # Static files (CSS, JS, images)
├── storage/             # Database and logs
├── templates/           # HTML templates
├── db.go                # Database setup
├── go.mod               # Dependencies
├── main.go              # Application entry point
└── settings.toml        # Configuration
```

## Key Directories

### `apps/`
This is where your application logic resides. Each subdirectory represents a separate "app" (similar to Django apps), containing its own models, controllers, migrations, and routes. This promotes modularity and reusability.

### `static/`
Contains static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images. These files are served directly by the web server.

### `storage/`
Stores data files (for SQLite), logs, and other persistent data generated by the application.

### `templates/`
Holds your HTML templates. Bourbon uses Go's `html/template` package with some enhancements.

## Key Files

### `main.go`
The entry point of your application. It initializes the app, connects to the database, registers routes, and starts the server.

### `db.go`
Contains database initialization logic. You can customize connection settings, run migrations, and seed data here.

### `settings.toml`
The main configuration file for your application. It controls database settings, server configuration, logging, and more.

### `go.mod`
Defines the Go module and its dependencies.

## App Structure (`apps/<app_name>/`)

Each app typically contains:

- `models.go`: GORM model definitions.
- `controllers.go`: HTTP handlers and business logic.
- `routes.go`: Route registration for the app.
- `migrations/`: Auto-generated migration files.
